# Party-Game

This is a personal project to develop a Mario Party type game to play with friends, currently being written primarily in JavaScript.

The premise of this is to randomly select from a list of games, including Mario Party games, where a random Minigame will also be chosen.

To keep things fresh, the idea is also to not have a game/event repeat for several rounds.

Currently, only the Free for all part of the game is functional and is subject to additions.

Eventually, 3v1 and 2v2 will be functional, the base functions in FFA are coded in a way that they work. In theory, all that should be needed is to copy the arrays and functions over to their respective files and rename them to fit what I am trying to do.

...in addition to copying the same functions for when other Mario Party games are chosen.

In addition, some future additions once the current files are stable:

Bowser-esque game choices/scenarios
Random Events for green spaces
Random board generation?
Random events on the map, random event generation for the map, for instances, the map has a proverbial rocket takes you from once space to another way across the board.

More things to come!
